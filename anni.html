    <h1 class="poem-title">Two Years of Love: Memories and Milestones</h1>
    <pre>
As I think back on our two years together,
My heart fills with love and memories to treasure.
I recall our first date, walking down Revolution,
Feeling a connection that would lead to a love revolution.

I remember our second date,
 when I missed your gift of chocolate,
But you forgave me,
and our love story only got better.
We rode our motorbike around the city in year one,
Free and happy, under the warmth of the summer sun.

I remember when you got sick with Covid-19,
And how I was there for you, holding you through the pain.
We healed together, our love growing stronger.

We've had a summer day by the swimming pool,
Splashing around and enjoying the cooling water cool.
We've had fights and we've had fixes,
Our love persevering, through all our conflicts.

You know both my light side and my dark side,
And yet you love me still, your love is like the tide.
Our memories of laughter and love,
Are what make our journey truly worthwhile and prove.

As we celebrate our two-year anniversary,
I want you to know how much you mean to me.
You are my partner, my love, my everything,
And I will love you forever, with each passing spring.
    </pre>
